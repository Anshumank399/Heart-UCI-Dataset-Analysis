# Heart-UCI-Dataset-Analysis

Heart disease being one of the most common and feared diseases that takes away many lives, it is important to more deeply understand it.  
This is a repository for basic exploratory data analysis on the Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI database.

#### Steps Involved

* Business Understanding  
This means understanding the problem and questions you are interested in tackling in the context of whatever domain you're working in. I have framed a few questions and tried answering them using visualizations.
* Data Understanding  
You might already have data that could be used to answer the questions, or you might have to collect data to get at your questions of interest. The data for this project was collected from the UCI database.
* Data Processing  
The wrangling and cleaning process is one of the most time consuming part of the data analysis process. The dataset is relatively clean one but all the checks were done to see data disparity and missing data.
* Modeling  
Data processing answers most of the questions but when an estimate is to be made into the future the model building technique helps. 
* Evalutaion  
Asses the model you built using a score metric on the test data.
* Deployment  
Deploy the model for future use.


Python language has been used for the analysis.
